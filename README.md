## Static3JS
This is an experiment using Three.js and its HDRI/EXR rendering capabilities to light scenes.

### How to use
The camera in the scene is locked, with rotation being controlled by moving the cursor to the edges of the screen. Time of day can be adjusted by scrolling/swiping up and down.

### Demo
A live demo can be found on [here on finis.cool](https://www.finis.cool/static3js). It may take some time to load the high resolution .exr files.
